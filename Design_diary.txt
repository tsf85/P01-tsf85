First, I feel like I should mention that while my status at the school is that of a senior, I've 
been out of school for years and am very much coming back as a freshman as far as CS goes as I 
switched majors. 

This whole thing was a struggle, which was very educational. I was originally was going to do something
with the steam API, but after a couple days of trying to figure that out, I decided it was a bit over
my head. Then I struggled to understand scraping and all that syntax I would need for that. I feel like
I spent about 19/20 of my time just researching how to do any single thing I wanted to do and the rest
actually writing anything.

An issue I was unable to resolve was in the second url I scraped. I wasn't able to figure out how to get
specific enough to ommit a few pieces of text that weren't boardgame names. After beating my head against
this for most of a day, I decided it didn't matter since the main function of the script is to find games
in common between two reviewers, which would leave that irrelevant text alone anyway. Not elegant, but I
couldn't figure it out yet.

Advice for a future student? start super simple and get more complicated and add ideas as you're figuring
out the basics.

The most fun part of the assignment was seeing my first bit of actual codex that I wanted to writex actually
do something. I saw the list of boardgames was stoked.

I'd like to go back and improve the script by adding in more reviewers and resolving the issue with irrelevant
text. Maybe add in some data analysis for comparing what kind of boardgame genres people like and over-lap on
with other people.
